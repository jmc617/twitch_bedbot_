# Bedbot

[Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/) chatbot client created using [Tmi.js](https://tmijs.com/). Listens to chat and re-sends user messages with a humorous ending at set intervals. 
Created as a gift for [Shellieface](https://www.twitch.tv/shellieface). Will be updated to use the [bedbot API](https://github.com/jmc617/bedbot-api) to save user data and join multiple chat streams.
